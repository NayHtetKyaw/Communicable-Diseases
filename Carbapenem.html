                <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbapenems are strong antibiotics that doctors use to treat severe bacterial infections. Some Enterobacteriaceae are resistant to carbapenems, and most other common antibiotics. These are called
                    Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to the carbapenem class of antibiotics, considered the drugs
                    of last resort for such infections. They are resistant because they produce an enzyme called a carbapenemase that disables the drug molecule. The resistance can vary from moderate to severe. Enterobacteriaceae are common commensals
                    and infectious agents. Experts fear CRE as the new "superbug". The bacteria can kill up to half of patients who get bloodstream infections. Tom Frieden, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has referred to
                    CRE as "nightmare bacteria". Examples of enzymes found in certain types of CRE are KPC and NDM. KPC and NDM are enzymes that break down carbapenems and make them ineffective. Both of these enzymes, as well as the enzyme VIM have also
                    been reported in Pseudomonas.
                    <h3>Who's at risk?</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRE-related infections are associated with high mortality rates and are often responsible for outbreaks in health care settings. People whose care requires devices such as breathing machines (ventilators) or catheters
                    and long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk of CRE infections.
                    <h3>CRE prevention</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preventing the spread of CRE and other antibiotic-resistant infections begins with practicing good hand-washing using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Establishing healthy lifestyle habits such
                    as eating a proper diet, getting enough exercise and maintaining good sleep patterns also can reduce the risk of illness. It's also important to avoid overusing and misusing antibiotics, such as taking antibiotics when they're not
                    the appropriate treatment. Antibiotics are designed to work against infections caused by bacteria, fungi and certain parasites â€” not infections caused by viruses. If you are prescribed an antibiotic, take the medicine only as directed
                    and be sure to complete the full treatment course, even if you feel better after a couple of days. Health care facilities also are encouraged to: Follow proper contact precautions when putting on and removing gowns and gloves Minimize
                    the use of invasive devices such as urinary catheters Have in place appropriate infection control precautions when CRE are identified Use antibiotics appropriately
