                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare but serious infection that can become life threatening if it isn’t treated. The symptoms can be like those of the flu, and they can get worse quickly. People usually
                    get HPS by breathing air that is infected by urine, droppings, or saliva of mice and other rodents that have hantavirus, a group of viruses found in wild rodents. This virus doesn’t make the rodents sick. In people, it mainly harms
                    the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The best way to avoid the disease is to stay away from rodents and the places where they live. In the United States, there has not been a single documented case of a person passing along the virus to
                    another person. There isn’t a cure or vaccine, but doctors are able to give oxygen therapy to people with HPS. The earlier it is diagnosed, the better your chances of recovering.
                    <h3>What Causes It?</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by several types of viruses that are carried by different kinds of rodents. The primary carrier in North America is the deer mouse. Others include: The white-tailed mouse
                    The cotton rat The rice rat.People most often get the virus if they breathe air that has been poisoned by waste or fluids from an infected rodent. People most at risk for HPS are those who are often in areas where rodents live. It’s
                    most common in spring and summer and in the western part of the United States. It also is found in Canada and South America. In Asia, other hantaviruses cause kidney problems instead of lung issues.
                    <h3>Tips for Campers</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you enjoy the great outdoors, you may naturally come across rodents. When you camp, air out abandoned or seldom-used cabins and check for signs of rodents before you settle in. Other ideas: Check the area around
                    outdoor sleeping spots. Don’t sleep on the bare ground; bring a tent with a floor or mat. Better yet, have a cot. Stay away from woodpiles or garbage areas when you bed down. Keep food sealed, including pet food. Burn your garbage
                    following the campsite’s instructions.
                    <h3>Prevention</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to avoid HPS is simple: Avoid contact with mice and rats and the areas where they live. If you live, work, or play in areas that have rodents, be sure to your home and work area as clean as possible.
                    Other things you can do: Seal holes in structures with cement, wire screens, or metal flashing. Trap the rodents (use snap traps and not glue traps, which allow them to urinate or leave droppings). Store your food properly Call an
                    exterminator or your health department if you need more advice or tips.
