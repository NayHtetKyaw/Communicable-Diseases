                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV weakens a person's ability to fight infections. It is mostly contracted through unprotected sex or needle sharing. Signs may include fever,
                    headache, and swollen lymph nodes. An HIV test confirms diagnosis. Medications suppress the virus to help you stay healthy, prevent the spread of HIV, and delay or prevent the onset of AIDS. With treatment, HIV-positive persons can
                    live normal, healthy lives. The human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, weakens your immune system so it can't fight off common germs, viruses, fungi, and other invaders. It's the virus that causes AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
                    Someone with HIV can get sick from things that don't usually affect people, and people with AIDS tend to get certain uncommon diseases and illnesses. Anyone can get HIV. Both men and women can spread HIV. A person with HIV can feel
                    OK and still give the virus to others. According to the CDC, about 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with the HIV infection, and there are about 37,600 new HIV infections each year. Having HIV does not always mean that you
                    have AIDS. It can take many years for people with the virus to develop AIDS. HIV and AIDS can't be cured, but the medications available today help people stay healthy, live longer, and even obtain a normal life expectancy.
                    <h3>How You Can Get It</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can get HIV when an infected person's body fluids -- including blood, semen, fluids from the vagina, or breast milk -- get into your blood. That can happen through broken skin or the linings in your mouth,
                    anus, penis, or vagina. People commonly get HIV from: Having unprotected sex with an infected person Sharing a needle to take drugs Dirty needles used for a tattoo or in body piercing Mothers with HIV also can give the virus to their
                    babies, before or when they're born or through breastfeeding. It's possible to get HIV from a blood transfusion from an infected person, although it's very unlikely in the U.S. and Western Europe, where all medical blood is tested
                    for HIV. Health care workers have to take special precautions. They could get HIV after being poked with needles that have HIV-infected blood or after infected blood gets on an open cut or splashes into their eyes or inside their nose.
                    The best way to protect yourself from HIV is to avoid activities that put you at risk. Use latex condoms or a latex barrier whenever you have sex -- vaginal, anal, or oral. Don't inject drugs, and don't use someone else's needle if
                    you do. Some people who are at very high risk for an HIV infection use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). They don't have HIV yet, but they take medicines every day to help lower their chance of getting infected.
                    <h3>Symptoms of HIV and AIDS</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people get flu-like symptoms within a month after they've been infected, but these symptoms often go away within a month. You could have HIV for many years before feeling ill at all. Before you're diagnosed
                    with HIV, you may get shingles. If you have had HIV for many years, you may get other infections related to advance HIV pr AIDS (see below). Both women and men may get thrush, a kind of yeast infection in your mouth or on your tongue.
                    Women could get severe vaginal yeast infections. Signs that HIV is turning into AIDS include: A fever that won't go away Shortness of breath Diarrhea that won't go away Sweating while you sleep Feeling tired all the time, but not from
                    stress or lack of sleep Losing weight Swollen glands in your neck, groin, or underarms Yeast infections in your mouth
                    <h3>Outlook</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people who get the right treatment will do well and live healthy lives for years. Starting ART soon after diagnosis of HIV infection, especially before the CD4 count drops to low levels, is key. Even with
                    treatment, though, some people may get sicker faster than others. Take good care of yourself. Build a good relationship with an experienced doctor specializing in HIV and AIDS. Stick to your HIV medication schedule, and get regular
                    lab work to catch any problems early.
                    <h3>Related Infections and Illnesses</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People with AIDS can get other infections very easily. These "opportunistic infections" aren't a problem for someone with a healthy immune system, but someone with a low CD4 count can't fight them off. They can
                    lead to a diagnosis of AIDS because doctors know that HIV probably played a role.Some health problems that people with AIDS often have are: Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin tumor that looks like dark or purple blotches on their skin or in
                    their mouth Mental changes and headaches caused by fungal infections or tumors in their brain and spinal cord Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing because of infections in their lungs Dementia Severe malnutrition Chronic diarrhea
