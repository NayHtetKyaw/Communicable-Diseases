                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yellow fever is a viral infection transmitted by a bite from infected mosquitoes most commonly found in parts of South America and Africa. When transmitted to humans, the yellow fever virus can damage the
                    liver and other internal organs and be potentially fatal. The World Health Organization estimates there are 200,000 cases of yellow fever worldwide each year, resulting in 30,000 deaths. Yellow fever appears to be on the rise internationally,
                    due to a decreased immunity to infection among local populations, deforestation, climate change, and high-density urbanization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yellow fever is a viral disease of typically short duration. In most cases, symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains particularly in the back, and headaches. Symptoms typically
                    improve within five days. In about 15% of people, within a day of improving the fever comes back, abdominal pain occurs, and liver damage begins causing yellow skin. If this occurs, the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is increased.
                    The disease is caused by yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of an infected female mosquito. It infects only humans, other primates, and several types of mosquitoes. In cities, it is spread primarily by Aedes aegypti, a type
                    of mosquito found throughout the tropics and subtropics. The virus is an RNA virus of the genus Flavivirus. The disease may be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses, especially in the early stages. To confirm a suspected case,
                    blood-sample testing with polymerase chain reaction is required.

                    <h3>How High Is the Risk of Yellow Fever?</h3> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The CDC has identified 44 countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission, many of them with tropical climates. While the actual number
                    of yellow fever cases among U.S. and European travelers to these at-risk countries is low, vaccination is advised for most international travelers to these countries, because yellow fever has no cure and can be deadly. How Does Yellow
                    Fever Spread? Yellow fever is typically spread to humans from bites by infected mosquitoes. People cannot spread yellow fever among themselves through casual contact, although the infection could possibly be transmitted directly into
                    the blood through contaminated needles. A few different species of mosquitoes transmit the yellow fever virus; some breed in urban areas, others in jungles. Mosquitoes that breed in the jungle also transmit yellow fever to monkeys,
                    who, in addition to humans, are a host for the disease.
                    <h3>How Does Yellow Fever Spread?</h3>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yellow fever is typically spread to humans from bites by infected mosquitoes. People cannot spread yellow fever among themselves through casual contact, although the infection could possibly be transmitted
                    directly into the blood through contaminated needles. A few different species of mosquitoes transmit the yellow fever virus; some breed in urban areas, others in jungles. Mosquitoes that breed in the jungle also transmit yellow fever
                    to monkeys, who, in addition to humans, are a host for the disease.
                    <h3>Yellow Fever Symptoms</h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yellow fever gets its name from two of its most obvious symptoms: fever and yellowing of the skin. The yellowing occurs because the disease causes liver damage,
                    hepatitis. For some people, yellow fever has no initial symptoms, while for others, the first symptoms appear from three to six days after exposure to the virus from a mosquito bite. An infection with yellow fever typically has three
                    phases. The first phase of symptoms can last for three to four days and then, for most people, disappears. The first phase is generally non-specific and cannot be distinguished from other viral infections. The initial symptoms of yellow
                    fever are: Fever and chills Flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches, headache, and vomiting
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most people will not have symptoms. Some people will develop yellow fever illness with initial symptoms including: Sudden onset of fever Chills Severe headache Back pain General body
                    aches Nausea Vomiting Fatigue (feeling tired) Weakness Most people with the initial symptoms improve within one week. For some people who recover, weakness and fatigue (feeling tired) might last several months. A few people will develop
                    a more severe form of the disease. For 1 out of 7 people who have the initial symptoms, there will be a brief remission (a time you feel better) that may last only a few hours or for a day, followed by a more severe form of the disease.
                    Severe symptoms include: High fever Yellow skin (jaundice) Bleeding Shock Organ failure Severe yellow fever disease can be deadly. If you develop any of these symptoms, see a healthcare provider immediately. Among those who develop
                    severe disease, 30-60% die.
