                <p>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A communicable disease is one that is spread from one person to another through a variety of ways that include: contact with blood and bodily fluids; breathing in an airborne virus; or
                    by being bitten by an insect. Reporting of cases of communicable disease is important in the planning and evaluation of disease prevention and control programs, in the assurance of appropriate medical therapy, and in the detection
                    of common-source outbreaks. California law mandates healthcare providers and laboratories to report over 80 diseases or conditions to their local health department. Some examples of the reportable communicable diseases include Hepatitis
                    A, B & C, influenza, measles, and salmonella and other food borne illnesses.
                    <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do these communicable diseases spread? How these diseases spread depends on the specific disease or infectious agent. Some ways in which communicable diseases spread are by:<br>
                    <br>1) Physical contact with an infected person, such as through touch (staphylococcus), sexual intercourse (gonorrhea, HIV), fecal/oral transmission (hepatitis A), or droplets (influenza, TB)<br>
                    <br>2) Contact with a contaminated surface or object (Norwalk virus), food (salmonella, E. coli), blood (HIV, hepatitis B), or water (cholera);<br>
                    <br>3) Bites from insects or animals capable of transmitting the disease (mosquito: malaria and yellow fever; flea: plague);<br>
                    <br>4) Travel through the air, such as tuberculosis or measles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fever: &nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this guidance, fever is defined as a temperature >100.0◦ F orally; an oral temperature of 100 ◦ F is approximately equivalent to 101 ◦ F rectally or temporally (Temporal Artery Forehead scan), or 99.5◦ F axillary
                    (armpit). Diarrhea: Loose or watery stools of increased frequency that is not associated with change in diet. Vomiting: Two or more episodes of vomiting in a 24 hour period.
                </p>
                <p>Exclusion:&nbsp;&nbsp; Children may be excluded for medical reasons related to communicable diseases or due to program or staffing requirements. In general, children should be excluded when they are not able to fully participate with the
                    program, or in the case of child care settings, when their level of care needed during an illness is not able to be met without jeopardizing the health and safety of the other children, or when there is a risk or spread to other children
                    that cannot be avoided with appropriate environmental or individual management. For exclusion, all applicable COMAR regulations should be followed; for youth camps, specifically COMAR 10.16.06.31 “Exclusion for Acute Illness and Communicable
                    Disease”.
                </p>
                <p>Fever:&nbsp;&nbsp; A child may have a fever for many reasons. If a child has a fever, all applicable COMAR regulations should be followed. In addition, any child with a fever and behavior changes or other symptoms or signs of an acute
                    illness should be excluded and parents notified. Once diagnosed, exclusion due to fever should be based on disease-specific guidelines or other clinical guidance from the child’s health care provider. Also, it is important to be sure
                    the appropriate method for measuring temperature is used based on the age or developmental level of the child.</p>
                <p>An unexplained fever in any child younger than 3 months requires medical evaluation. Fever in an infant the day following an immunization known to cause fever, may be admitted along with health care provider recommendations for fever management
                    and indications for contacting the health care provider. Instructions from the health care provider should include: the immunizations given, instructions for administering any fever reducing medication, and medication authorizations
                    signed by the parent and the health care provider.</p>
                <p>Diarrhea: &nbsp;&nbsp;Diarrhea may result in stools that are not able to be contained by a diaper or be controlled/contained by usual toileting practices. An infectious cause of diarrhea may not be known by the school, child care facility,
                    or camp at the time of exclusion or return. Documentation of the cause of diarrhea should be sought. A child with diarrhea should be excluded if:
                    <li>Stool is not able to be contained in a diaper or in the toilet, or child is soiling undergarments</li><br>
                    <li>Stool contains blood</li><br>
                    <li>Child is ill or has any signs of acute illness</li><br>
                    <li>Diarrhea is accompanied by fevern</li><br>
                    <li>Child shows evidence of dehydration (such as reduced urine or dry mouth) With appropriate documentation, a child with diarrhea may be readmitted to care, school, or camp when:</li><br>
                    <li>An infectious cause of diarrhea (see chart) has been treated and the child is cleared by a health care provider, in conjunction with the local health department, if necessary</li><br>
                    <li>The diarrhea has been determined by the local health department to not be an infectious risk to others</li>
                </p>
                <p>Vomiting:&nbsp;&nbsp; An infectious cause of vomiting may not be known by the school, child care facility, or camp at the time of exclusion or return. Documentation of the cause of vomiting should be sought. Child should be excluded until
                    vomiting resolves or until a health care provider clears for return (is not contagious).
