                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis A, also called hep A, is a contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. Some people have only a mild illness that lasts a few weeks. Others have more severe problems that can last months.
                    You usually get the disease when you eat or drink something contaminated by poop from a person who has the virus. The hepatitis A virus usually isn’t dangerous. Almost everyone who has it gets better. But because it can take a while
                    to go away, you’ll need to take care of yourself in the meantime.
                    <h3>Hepatitis A Causes</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can catch the disease by drinking water or eating food that's been contaminated by someone with the virus. You can also get hepatitis A if you: Eat fruits, vegetables, or other foods handled or prepared by
                    a person who has the virus Eat raw shellfish harvested from water where the virus lives Swallow contaminated ice Have sex with someone who has it Touch your mouth after touching a contaminated object
                    <h3>Hepatitis A Risk Factors</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could be at higher risk of getting the disease if you: Have close contact with someone who's infected Travel to countries where hepatitis A is common Are homeless Use recreational drugs, even without needles
                    Have a blood clotting disorder like hemophilia Work with primates Have HIV Also at higher risk are: Men who have sex with men Kids in child care and their teachers
                    <h3>Hepatitis A Symptoms</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have this infection, the virus is causing inflammation in your liver. Some people, especially many children, don’t have symptoms. Others might have: Jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) Belly pain Dark urine
                    Loss of appetite Upset stomach Vomiting Itching Pale-colored poop Joint pain Fever Diarrhea Fatigue These problems tend to go away after about 2 months but might keep coming back for up to 6 months. You can spread the hepatitis A virus
                    even if you feel fine. You can also spread it about 2 weeks before your symptoms appear and during the first week after they show up.
