                <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Is Enterovirus D68?</h1>

                <img src="media/entero.jpeg " width="800px " height="400x ">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterovirus D68 is a virus that can make you feel like you have a cold. If it's severe, it could also make you wheeze or have trouble breathing, especially if you have asthma or other respiratory
                    problems. Most cases are mild and last about a week, but if it's severe, you may need to go to the hospital. Babies, children, and teens are the most likely to get it. People with weak immune systems and those with severe chronic medical
                    conditions have the biggest risk for severe complications. This virus isn't new. Experts first identified it in 1962. In the decades since then, it only seemed to impact a very small number of people. That changed in 2014, when the
                    CDC reported a national outbreak. There are more than 100 other enteroviruses.
                    <h3>Who's At Risk?</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone can get it, but children age 6 weeks to 16 years may be especially vulnerable. Infants and people who have immune system disorders are the most likely to develop severe complications.
                    <h3>How It Spreads</h3>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can catch this virus the same way you would catch the common cold: by having close contact with someone who's infected -- especially if that person coughs or sneezes on you -- or by touching a contaminated
                    surface. You can lower your chances of getting it by following these tips: Wash your hands often. Scrub with soap for 20 seconds. (especially before eating) Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth unless you've just washed your hands.
                    Don't hug, kiss, or share food with anyone who's sick. If someone in your house is ill, it's a good idea to regularly disinfect surfaces that are touched a lot, such as toys and doorknobs. A person who is ill should always cover their
                    mouth when coughing/sneezing, wear a mask and wash hands often. Staying in a separate room in the house helps contain the infection.
